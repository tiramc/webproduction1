      <h2>Gorillas in the Mist</h2>
      <p>Wonders abound within the dense vegetation of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, home to more than half of the world's mountain gorillas. For our Gorillas in the Mist Safari tour, you will hike into this dense forest looking for a  family of gorillas. Sharing space with the stunning male silverback gorilla and his family will be a life-changing experience. Permits are highly limited and tracking groups small.
